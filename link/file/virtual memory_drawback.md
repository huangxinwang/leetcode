## Virtual Memory 

- [ref](http://instant.1point3acres.com/thread/143927)

### Advantages
- Run more applications at once
- Run larger applications with less real RAM
- You don't have buy more memory RAM

### Disadvantages
- Applications run slower
- It takes more time to switch between applications
- Less hard drive space for your use

The disadvantage is that Virtual Memory systems tend to be slow and require additional support from the system's hardware for address translations. It can be said that the execution speed of a process in a Virtual Memory system can equal, but never exceed, the execution speed of the same process with Virtual Memory turned off.
