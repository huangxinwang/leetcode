/**
* Problem Statement: Course Schedule
*
*here are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
*
*Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
**
*Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
*
*For example:
*
*2, [[1,0]]
*There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
*
*2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
*There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
